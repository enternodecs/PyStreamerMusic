# PyStreamerMusic
A simple Python application to play music and save the current playing song to a text file, so that OBS may read it.

**NOTE: THIS IS NOT COMPLETE. DO NOT TRY TO USE IT.**

##Why does this exist?
This exists because I couldn't find a good solution for simply playing a .mp3 file and making a formatted text file with the name of the song in it. This application seeks to be simple: play music, save song info to text file.

##May I contribute code?
Please wait until the application is mature to contribute. Post feature requests as issues.
